      <description>&lt;p&gt;I began using the the &lt;a href=&#34;http://searls.github.com/jasmine-maven-plugin&#34;&gt;Jasmine Maven Plugin&lt;/a&gt; in June of 2012 and was immediately impressed with how well it worked and how easy it made automating my test execution. Soon after I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://requirejs.org&#34;&gt;require.js&lt;/a&gt; and decided to begin using it in my applications. I learned quickly however that the require.js support in the Jasmine Maven Plugin had quite a few issues and so I decided to try and help fix some of them.

Fast-forward to January of this year and I found myself a maintainer of the plugin with full commit access and a huge list of issues (thank you &lt;a href=&#34;http://about.me/searls&#34;&gt;Justin Searls&lt;/a&gt; for the opportunity). I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few goals for my first release:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

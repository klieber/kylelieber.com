      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a lot of discussions with analysts in my organization about how to version software using Maven and I&amp;rsquo;m finding there is a common misconception about what SNAPSHOT actually means. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a good blog to send them that helps explain versioning in Maven but unfortunately everything I&amp;rsquo;ve found merely discusses version formats and not how to use them as you&amp;rsquo;re developing an application. So, I decided I would take a stab at it. I welcome any comments and constructive criticism that will help me improve this document, so please feel free.

First off, a SNAPSHOT is not the same thing as an alpha/beta/etc version. It is a special keyword that means it is the latest version of your code. This means it changes. If you pulled down someapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT yesterday and then you try to pull it down today it will most likely not be the same. This also means if you have a project dependent on a SNAPSHOT version, maven will need to check the remote repository for changes every time you run a build.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

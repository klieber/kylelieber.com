      <description>Many of the teams at my organization began using Spring REST Docs to document our REST APIs over the last couple of years. We really like the freedom it gives you to design your documentation as you wish while still giving you reliable snippets that are validated through tests. Of course, the only thing its missing is the ability to generate an API specification document like OpenAPI. This recently became a requirement that we are able to provide such a document so many thought we would need to abandon Spring REST Docs.</description>
